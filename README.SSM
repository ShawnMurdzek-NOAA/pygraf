Additional Notes

1. The list of all possible fields that can be plotted is in adb_graphics/default_specs.yml. This
    file also contains the configuration of each of those plots (e.g., colorbars, contour levels, 
    etc.)

2. create_graphics.py is the primary driver. Functions are defined first, with the actual code that
    calls these functions being at the very end.
